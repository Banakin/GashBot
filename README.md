# Gash Twitter Bot

The source code of the [@GashRTs](https://twitter.com/GashRTs) twitter bot that was built using [tweepy](http://tweepy.org/) and is powered by [Heroku](https://heroku.com/). This twitter bot was also coded with [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) and was coded by [Banakin](https://banakin.net/).


----------

## Using

Using bot.py is pretty easy and it just requires you to know how to run python and how to use [Twitter Apps](https://apps.twitter.com).

 1. First download/install python 3 from [python.org](https://python.org).
 2. Install tweepy via pip `If your using Pythonista use StaSh` [link](https://github.com/ywangd/stash)
 3.  Open up bot.py and replace the variables with the things specific to your twitter account and twitter app (You need to make the twitter app)
 4. Run bot.py and it should all work
